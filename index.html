            <p class="py-6 px-2 mx-6 drop-shadow-sm sm:px-2 md:px-6 lg:px-8">While delivering a student's dry cleaning, Geum Jan Di saves the life of a heavily bullied student,Lee Min Ha/Lee Ji Ha, at the most prestigious school in South Korea. Her actions soon became public and exposes the bullying within the school, leading the public to go against the Shinhwa empire. To silence the public's attention, Jan Di is offered a swimming scholarship to Shinhwa High School which she declines but her family forces her to attend. 
            </p>
            <p class="py-6 px-2 mx-6 drop-shadow-sm sm:px-2 md:px-6 lg:px-8">During her first day at Shinhwa, Jan Di learns of the famous F4 and of the other students' adoration and fixation with the boys in the group. Gu Jun Pyo, Yoon Ji Hoo, So Yi Jung, and Song Woo Bin are the richest and most powerful kids within Shinhwa and South Korea. Subsequently, they use their power to terrorize weaker students or those they do not like. Jan Di, instead of being impressed, becomes enraged and fantasizes about confronting Gu Jun Pyo, the leader and initiator of many of the bullying acts. She gains courage to confront him when a friend, Oh Min Ji, accidentally spills ice cream on his shoes and he demands the girl to lick it off. Jan Di defends her friend and attempts to reason with Jun Pyo's tyrannical demand. He refuses to relent and demands her to lick it herself. Acting like she's going to lick it, she bends down but shoves her own ice cream in his face. Enraged by this, Gu Jun Pyo declares war on Jan Di and encourages the other students to bully her. Jan Di, however, is resistant, refusing to apologize to Gu Jun Pyo, and stands by her decision to fight him. - <a href="https://www.fanpop.com/clubs/boys-over-flowers/articles/63151/title/boys-over-flowers-synopsis">miskyella</a></p>

            <p class="text-center py-6 px-2 mx-6 drop-shadow-sm sm:px-2 md:px-6 lg:px-8"> The beginning of episode 5 starts as a continuation of episode 4's drama of which one of the male love interests, Gu Jun Pyo, was manipulated into believing Geum Jan Di  was cheating on him. After having discovered it was her best friend who set her up out of jealousy, he returned to the school to find her. There, he found her being maliciously bullied by many classmates and rescued her from the scene. He apologized for not believing her and took her to his mansion where he treated her wounds himself.  </p>
            <p class="text-center py-6 px-2 mx-6 drop-shadow-sm sm:px-2 md:px-6 lg:px-8">There is much more to this episode including an entire beach vacation and some great bonding moments, but the moment I truely wanted these two to work out was when I saw the look on Gu Jun Pyo's face when he finally realized there were consequences to his actions.</p>
